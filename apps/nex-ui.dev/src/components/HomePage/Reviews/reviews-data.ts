What's more, the parts that I didn't like (Styling from JS Objects, slow with big forms) have been addressed in v7. Please keep it up, this library deserves more exposure, it just works and works well and beautifully. Many thanks to <a href='https://github.com/rtivital' target='_blank'>@rtivital</a> and the contributors!</p>",
